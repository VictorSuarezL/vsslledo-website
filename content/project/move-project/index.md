title: Move Project
summary: 'The aim of the MOVE project is to provide a research-informed contribution towards improving the conditions of the mobility of young people in Europe and a reduction of the negative impacts of mobility through the identification of ways of good practice thus fostering sustainable development and well-being. The main research question of the study is: How can the mobility of young people be ‘good’ both for socio-economic development and for individual development of young people, and what are the factors that foster/hinder such beneficial mobility? The results will be compared and interpreted together in order to reconstruct patterns of mobility, to identify factors hindering/fostering youth mobility in the EU and good practice.'
